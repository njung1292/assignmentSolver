================

The Dietrich College advisors at Carnegie Mellon University face the problem of registering roughly 350 freshmen into about 22 seminars each year. For years they have been balancing the registration results and resolving conflicts by hand. Our project team aims to apply operations research techniques to reach an optimal assignment solution in a programmatic way.
Our program solves this assignment problem by applying the Hungarian algorithm.
